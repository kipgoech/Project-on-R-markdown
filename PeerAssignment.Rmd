##Reading data from local directory
I will use the function **read.csv** to load the data
```{r}
Activity<-read.csv("D://Self-made//Data science//Project-on-R-markdown//activity.csv")
```
After loading the data, we know hit on the *data mining*
first lets determine the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
DailySteps<-Activity%>%
  group_by(date)%>%
  na.omit()%>%
  summarise(DailySteps=sum(steps))
DailySteps
```
Lets visualize our data with Histogram to check daily steps
```{r}
with(DailySteps,hist(DailySteps,breaks = 53))
